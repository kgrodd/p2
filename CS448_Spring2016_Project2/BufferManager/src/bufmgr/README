Features
To make the buffer manager most effective, we made several data
structures such as Record.java which simply stores two ints 
but was effectively used to store an array of descriptors 
used for the buffers. This array words with the same indexes as
a page array, allowing us to easily maintain information
easily about every buffer in the pool.Our hashmap is 
also designed well andeven includes a helpful print statement.  

Roles
Tyler: Constructor, pinPage(), newPage(), flushPage(), printBufPool, HashMap
